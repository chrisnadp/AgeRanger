The app is set up to look for the db under C:\Temp


AgeRanger is a world leading application designed to identify person's age group!
The only problem with it is... It is not implemented - except a SQLite DB called AgeRanger.db.

To help AgeRanger to conquer the world please implement a web application that communicates with the DB mentioned above, and does the following:

 - Allows user to add a new person - every person has the first name, last name, and age;
 - Displays a list of people in the DB with their First and Last names, age and their age group. The age group should be determened based on the AgeGroup DB table - a person belongs to the age group where person's age >= 
 than group's MinAge and < than group's MaxAge. Please note that MinAge and MaxAge can be null;
 - Allows user to search for a person by his/her first or last name and displays all relevant information for the person - first and last names, age, age group.

In our fantasies AgeRanger is a single page application, and our DBA has already implied that he wants us to migrate it to SQL Server some time in the future.
And unit tests! We love unit tests!

Last, but not the least - our sales manager suggests you'll get bonus points if the application will also allow user to edit existing person records and expose a WEB API.

Please fork the project.

You are free to use any technology and frameworks you need. However if you decide to go with third party package manager or dev tool - don't forget to mention them in the README.md of your fork.

Good luck!
